
Public and professional awareness of lipedema is in its beginning stages. Correct identification of the disorder is the first step toward its managment.

Lipedema is a progressive disease characterized by a specific pattern of the accumulation in body fat, lumpy and painful areas within the fat, increasing adipose tissue, and lymphatic fluid accumulation. Calorie restrictive diets and exercise regimens are ineffective against the escalation of the disease.  Until recently this condition was treated with lyphedema therapies; however, new complimentary protocols are being tested.

Please give us a call to discuss these new therapies and to see if you are a candidate for receiving this promising new management technique.
