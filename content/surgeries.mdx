Because the lyphatic system is essential for detoxificaiton and immunity, a heathy funtioning lymphatic system is crucial for surgery preparation. A short series of Manual Lymphatic Drainage sessions can open any blockages in lymph nodes and optimize lymphatic flow thoughout the body, maximizing healing and recovery time.

Manual Lymphatic Drainage supports complete recovery from surgeries of any type. Whether it is a mandatory procedure or an elective surgery, we map a custom protocol specific to a patient's surgery type and unique needs. Our special therapies address anesthesia detoxification, incision care, decreasing swelling and fluid retention, scar minimisation, improving tissue quality and teture, and many more. 

We treat each case holistically, considering an individual’s physical and emotional experiences. Our care always considers a patient’s comfort level and is adjusted accordingly for progressive healing.
