Our Manual Lymphatic Drainage therapy is a gold-standard support for lymphedema (chronic interstitial swelling) management. We treat Secondary Lymphedema, where the cause is a disruption or damage to the lymphatic system, Primary Lymphedema, where the cause is from congenital or hereditary origin, and Idiopathic Lymphedema with no known cause. 

We carefully consider your detailed health and lifestyle history to ensure we create the optimal treatment plan for your needs. Treatment plans are frequently assessed and adjusted as healing progresses.

In addition to your in-office protocol, we also create a complimentary protocol for at-home supportive care, to secure the best therapeutic outcome.
