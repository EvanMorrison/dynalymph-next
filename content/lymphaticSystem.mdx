The lymphatic system consists of a network of organs and tissues that help the body shed waste and toxins. Its primary function is to carry lymph, a colorless fluid containing white blood cells critical to fighting infections, to all parts of the body. The method of transportation is a network of lymphatic vessels similar to the capillaries and veins that circulate blood. Lymphatic vessels carry lymph to the lymph nodes, which serve as filters. The human body contains several hundred lymph nodes; some are near the surface of the skin, but others are located much deeper.

Although blood circulates in an uninterrupted loop throughout the body, lymph only flows upward in the direction of the neck. Once the lymph nears the clavicles, veins re-introduce the lymph into the circulatory system. However, while the heart pumps blood throughout the body, the lymphatic system must rely on the movements of muscles and joints to pump lymphatic fluid back to the neck.
