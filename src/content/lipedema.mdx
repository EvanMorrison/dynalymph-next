Public and professional awareness of lipedema is in its beginning stages. Correct identification of the disorder is the first step toward its managment.

Lipedema is a progressive disease characterized by a specific pattern in the accumulation of body fat, lumpy and painful areas within the fat, increasing adipose tissue, and lymphatic fluid accumulation. Calorie restrictive diets and exercise regimens are ineffective against the escalation of the disease.  Until recently this condition has been treated with lymphedema therapies; however, new complimentary protocols are emerging.

Please give us a call to discuss these new therapies and to see if you are a candidate for receiving this promising new management technique.
