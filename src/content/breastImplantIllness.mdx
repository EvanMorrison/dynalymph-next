Long suspected, breast augmentation has now been  determined to cause numerous health issues. Previously unexplained health problems have been resolved with the removal, or "explant" of breast implants. Today we see a soaring number of explant procedures performed, with some plasitc surgeons specializing in this procedure exclusively.

Manual Lyphatic Drainage is appropriate for all breast explant patients to support detoxification, swelling and fluid reduction, scar management, and recovery of breast tissue quality.

We are expert at treating lymphatic-related breast issues and assure that we will always work within a patient's comfort level and tolerance.

Call today to see how we can help you manage your pre- and post- explant needs.
