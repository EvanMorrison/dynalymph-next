## WE ARE CURRENTLY CLOSED DUE TO COVID-19

Many of our clients are in high risk categories, and we have made the difficult decision to remain closed at this time. We plan to reopen when we are comfortable that we can once again provide extraodinary care without putting the most vulnerable at risk. With the recent arrival of vaccines, we are hopeful that we will begin taking appointments again in the not-too-distant future.

While we are not currently taking appointments, please feel free to call with any questions.
